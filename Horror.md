**Story plot**:
Start off with the narrator talking about the factory of marbles in Weselton and how it produced little to no marbles during the normal days, but when the waves were high, wildlife were aggresive and fire was bright and large, the production would skyrocket. The factory had peculiar traits, like the inconsistent colours of the marbles, but only the man knew the truth of these marbles. Next, zoom into a marble, a bright marble with a spot of black at its tip.

*First Person*
It was a boy that went to Weselton Elementary, and he starts off by talking with his friend about the test. He was disappointed by his bad results, and he expresses his desire to see into the future and to prevent it from happening. Move onto his road home and he saw the man's house, a beautiful house that he had always aspired to own.He had never seen the man, but he knew of the tales of his climb to the top along with the many conspiracies around him and his tendency of talking to the lower class.Coincidentally, the man just bumped into him and upon noticing the boy, the man scanned him, focusing on his pimple-filled forehead.The boy was embarrassed for he thought the man found him disgusting but still, he went to shake his hand to show respect.The man seemed pleased with him and reached out his hand. I shook it and he told me a story, a story about how he once longed to predict the future, and how he realised that he no longer needed to predict the future after he learnt about control. I was intrigued by his tale and he handed me an illustration of a fight, and said that we would meet again , walking away leaving a cloud of dust. The next day,I went back as before, but this time it was different as I limped, filled with vengeance. Then, he appeared, the man, the man whom I seemed to feel a great respect for. He seemed distraught and desperate today, as he ran towards me, asking me for help. Seeing him in such a state, I felt sympathy, and he asked me to buy his wares. He gave me a variety of paintings to choose from and upon seeing the one with a boy proudly lifting his test paper, I immediately chose it , hoping that I would get it. He cackled and told me that I was wise and he handed it to me.I took it , pondering over what he meant.The next day, I triumphantly walked back home, ready to face anything . The man this time however , did not come to me and he sat at his porch, this time looking weak and old, and he asked me to help him safekeep his life's work promptly before handing me an envelope. I brimmed with excitement , knowing his huge wealth and hoping that it was a cheque, a blank cheque. 

As I was walking , I opened the envelope and it was beyond me. It was a photograph that showed the death of a teen in gruesome detail and I walked across the road, wondering what it could possibly mean when suddenly, the sound of honking came from behind me and----

*Change back to third person*

As you can see, this boy was a gullible idiotic boy. He came from nothing and he ended with nothing, and I to this day ponder how such imbeciles could be the one in a million bright marble the marble that would rejuvenate my youth. Although I always liked to toy with that one in a million, this fool's desperation caused his loss and I would not have consumed this dim witted marble if not for the sake of my youth. Also you should know I am the man. Anyways, everyone has an equal chance to be that one in a million marble and whenever your marble breaks , you will come back , but when I decide to destroy the marbles or eat them, you're eternally lost. And I'll end off by telling you that as long as you remain , I will get you.
